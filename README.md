# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Please Note

1. The video will start on page load; but muted. Thus, you have to manually enable sound.
2. The video is looped.
3. Clicking a poster will only start the video if its source differs from what's already loaded. Clicking the poster again will NOT reload/pause the video if it's currently playing.
4. Flaw: The tooltip is confined to the window (horizontally) but can grow extremely tall.

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
